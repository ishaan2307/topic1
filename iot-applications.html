    <h2> Iot Applications Activity 1</h2>
    <p>In the seminar we learned that iot applications are devices or systems that connect to internet to automate various processes and that scalabilty and automation are features needed in it.Some examples are:- </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Smart Home</dt>
      <dt>Smart Locking System</dt>
      <dt>Smart shopping cart</dt>
      <dt>fitness trackers</dt>
      <dt>security systems</dt>
    </dl>

    <h3> Smart Building Activity 2</h3>
    <p> Smart in the term smart building means a building equipped with modern technology which includes safety and comfort. it also ensures sustainability. Main features needed in it are: -  these can be used in meeting room management, energy management etc. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connectivity</li>
      <li>Data Security</li>
      <li>Ability to integrate with other systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features can be used in various situations and places like: -</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meeting Room Management</li>
      <li>Energy Management</li>
      <li>Access Control</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Control Interface Activity 3</h4>
    <p>We learnt some high level features that can be used in the smart buildings to provide comfort and safety to the users: - </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using ultrasonic sensors or PIR sensors to sense motion and act on command to save assets like electricity.
      </li>
      <li>Security Features including Fire Detection.</li>
      <li>Using smoke or gas sensors for safety purposes in kitchen area.</li>
      <li>Using Fingerprint sensors for security purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are various parts needed to make this kind of iot application, some of them are: -</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screen for the user to interact with the systems.</li>
      <li>Monitoring devices : such as sensors like HC-SR04.</li>
      <li>keyboard and mouse to interact with the interface.</li>
      <li>Using ultrasonic sensors or PIR sensors to sense motion and act on command to save assets like electricity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There can be mnay users of this smart building, some of them include: -</p>
    <ul>
      <li>developers for testing.</li>
      <li>end users of customers.</li>
      <li>building maintenance people.</li>
      <li>security people.</li>
    </ul>
